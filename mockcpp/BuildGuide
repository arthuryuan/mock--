as a user
=========
	Linux
	------
	sudo make install 
	and then use /usr/local/include/mockcpp and /usr/local/lib/libmockcpp.a.
	if the test framework you use is not testngpp, such as cpputest, gtest etc. , you should enter a build dir, and then run these commands:
	cmake -DMOCKCPP_XUNIT=cpputest ../mockcpp/mockcpp
	make
	make install
	if you want to specify the install dir, you should run cmake as this:
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/somedir ../mockcpp/mockcpp 
	
	Windows
	-------
	Run cmake-gui.exe, choose the mockcpp root dir as source dir, and any other (nonexist) dir as binaries dir.
	Then hit configure button, it will show you some variables that should be set. if you do not care, let it be default, hit configure again.
	And then hit the generate button.

as a mockcpp maintainer
=======================
	Linux
	------
	make all
	it will make mockcpp and it's tests, and then run the tests.(build.sh do the same thing, and much faster.) 
	
	Windows
	-------
	run the PowerShell script build.ps1 .
	maybe you should modify some variables defined in the script first, such as the path of vcbuild/cmake, etc.

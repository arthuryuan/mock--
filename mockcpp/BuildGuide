as a user:
	sudo make install 
	and then use /usr/local/include/mockcpp and /usr/local/lib/libmockcpp.a.
	if the test framework you use is not testngpp, such as cpputest, gtest etc. , you should enter a build dir, and then run these commands:
	cmake -DMOCKCPP_XUNIT=cpputest ../mockcpp/mockcpp
	make
	make install
	if you want to specify the install dir, you should run cmake as this:
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/somedir ../mockcpp/mockcpp 

as a mockcpp maintainer:
	make all
	it will make mockcpp and it's tests, and then run the tests.(build.sh do the same thing, and much faster.)
